    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      Mesh ’N It Up was created by <strong>Tiffany Canaday</strong>, a disabled single mom
      with a lifelong love for crafting and creating.
    </p>

    <p>
      Living with Parkinson’s disease, Tiffany began making wreaths, candles,
      and handmade décor as a way to stay creative, active, and connected while
      at home.
    </p>

    <p>
      What started as a personal passion quickly became something bigger — a
      small, family-supported business rooted in creativity and love.
      Tiffany is proudly assisted by her sister, niece, and daughter, who help
      bring each piece to life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every item from Mesh ’N It Up is made with care, patience, and heart.
      These creations aren’t just décor — they represent perseverance, family,
      and the joy of making something meaningful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for supporting a small, family-run business and being part of our story.
